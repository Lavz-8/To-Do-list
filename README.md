# To-Do List Application

This project implements a simple and efficient To-Do List application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to manage their tasks with ease, providing functionality to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed.

## Features
- **Add Tasks**: Users can add new tasks to their to-do list.
